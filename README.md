# Predicting emotional reactions to Facebook posts by political actors

## Introduction

Emotions play a central role in social life, of which politics is no exception. Political science research has investigated systematic effects of emotions on politically relevant behavior such as turnout, vote choice, information search, and public attitudes.

Especially on social media, emotions are important, e.g. because false news on Twitter spread faster than true news, possibly because of invoked emotional responses. There is also evidence of emotional contagion on Facebook, shown by the observation that users exposed to fewer positive posts tend to produce fewer positive posts themselves. At the same time, social media provide political actors with unprecedented means to communicate directly to large audiences. Still, we know relatively little about the effects of emotional communication by political actors and its strategic use.

## Research question

Against this background, this research design set out a plan to investigate emotional reactions to social media posts from political actors. More specifically, I ask: Which characteristics explain the amount of specific emotional reactions a post gets?

Substantively, I argue that a systematic link between political communication and reactions to it is a necessary condition for political communication to be used strategically.
